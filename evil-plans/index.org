So that I can [[live a good life]]

2012-2017

Questions to resolve: 
- Would I prefer the structure of a regular career, or can I learn how to make the most of a more self-directed life?
- Do I understand my wants and needs enough to manage my finances with reasonable safety?

More information: http://sachachua.com/blog/experiment

What could "awesome" look like? 
- Good handle on expenses, resisted lifestyle inflation
- Expenses covered by dividends/capital gains, with a reasonable buffer for the next correction (and so that I can buy the next time stocks go on sale)
- Be the kind of happy, loving, equanimous person I want to be
- Icing on the cake:
  - Tickled brain from learning lots of things
  - Good karma from helping lots of people
  - Scaling up (building resources)

What kind of concrete actions or projects will move me towards that? What kinds of things do I want to explore?
- [X] E-book publishing: Easy to do once I have a clear idea of what I want to put together. I like pay-what-you-want.
- [X] Print publishing: Doable with LaTeX and CreateSpace. 
- [ ] Useful, organized non-fiction
- [ ] A way for people to self-identify as tribe members (ex: e-book purchases, mailing list signups)
- [ ] Git-tip and other microtipping
- See other projects in this file
